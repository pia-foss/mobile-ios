# Private Internet Access

Private Internet Access is the world's leading consumer VPN service. At Private Internet Access we believe in unfettered access for all, and as a firm supporter of the open source ecosystem we have made the decision to open source our VPN clients.

You need to request this entitlement to Apple or remove the call to `configureHotspotHelper()` in `AppDelegate.swift` and adapt the entitlements file to your needs.
